# dosha.ie
Postmodern audiences question grand narratives and embrace deconstruction of tradition. Deconstructivism, decolonialism, and eastern medical literacy challenge established structures in western culture, can lead with empowering individuals to navigate and question these systems, aligning with a "cognitive fingerprint" i.e model of behaviour called a dosha
using ayurvedic knowledge. Ayurveda is the traditional practice of medicine in hinduism, not commonly found in christian/catholic communities, so there is a gap in the irish market that could lead to a mutally beneficial relationsip for irish clients and practitioners.
