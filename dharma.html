            <h2>Understanding Dharma</h2>
            <p>
                Dharma is a fundamental concept in Hinduism, Buddhism, and other Eastern philosophies. It refers to the
                moral, ethical, and spiritual duties that individuals are expected to follow in their lives. These
                duties are often shaped by one's role in society, their relationships with others, and their personal
                path to spiritual fulfillment.
            </p>
        </section>

        <section id="duty">
            <h2>Dharma as Duty</h2>
            <p>
                In its most basic form, Dharma is about fulfilling one's duties, whether in a family, society, or in
                relation to the divine. It involves living in harmony with cosmic laws, contributing to the greater
                good, and maintaining balance in life. These duties can vary based on one’s age, caste, occupation, and
                other social roles.
            </p>
            <p>
                For instance, a parent’s duty is to care for their children, while a ruler's duty is to protect and
                govern with justice. Dharma emphasizes that by fulfilling these duties, individuals can live virtuous
                and righteous lives.

            <h2>Competing Interests in Dharma</h2>
            <p>
                While Dharma emphasizes fulfilling one's duties,
                it is often complicated by competing interests and moral dilemmas.
                In real life, individuals may encounter situations where fulfilling one duty conflicts with another.
                This tension is where Dharma as a guiding principle is truly tested.
            </p>
            <p>
                For example, a business leader may face the challenge of balancing the interests of their employees,
                customers, and shareholders. Each group has different needs and expectations,
                and fulfilling one set of interests may harm another.
                Here, Dharma teaches individuals to make decisions that maintain balance and integrity while considering
                the greater good.
            </p>
            <p>
                Similarly, personal desires and social obligations often conflict.
                A person may have the desire to pursue a career or hobby,
                but their duty to family may require sacrifices.
                Dharma encourages individuals to act in a way that does not disregard their own well-being
                but still adheres to moral responsibility and ethical living.

                <h3>Virtues such as Ahimsa (Non-Violence)</h3>
                <img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/9/9b/Emblem_of_Ahimsa.png/800px-Emblem_of_Ahimsa.png"
                    alt="Ahimsa symbol" class="dharma-img">
                <p>Ahimsa, which means non-violence or non-harm, is one of the most important virtues in various Indian
                    religions such as Hinduism, Buddhism, and Jainism. It is the ethical principle that emphasizes not
                    causing harm or violence in any form—be it physical, mental, or emotional—towards any living being.
                    Ahimsa is integral to Dharma because it encourages compassion, empathy, and peaceful coexistence
                    with all life forms.</p>
                <p>In practical terms, Ahimsa encourages actions and thoughts that avoid harm, promote peace, and
                    emphasize kindness. It is not limited to just actions but extends to speech and thoughts as well. By
                    practicing Ahimsa, individuals contribute to the well-being of society and promote an environment of
                    harmony and understanding.</p>

                    alt="Yoga pose" class="dharma-img">
                <p>Yoga in this context refers not just to physical postures (as commonly understood in the West) but to
                    a disciplined approach to life and spiritual practices aimed at achieving self-realization and union
                    with the divine. This involves practicing meditation, ethical conduct, mindfulness, and living
                    according to moral and spiritual guidelines.</p>

                    alt="Scales of Justice" class="dharma-img">
                <p>In the realm of law and justice, Dharma refers to the principles of righteousness, justice, and
                    ethical conduct that form the basis of legal systems in both ancient and modern times. It also
                    relates to moral principles regarding social behavior, fairness, and the protection of rights within
                    society.</p>

                    alt="Hindu Wedding Ritual" class="dharma-img">
                <p>Dharma also manifests in the form of rituals and rites of passage, including ceremonies and
                    observances that mark significant life transitions, such as birth, marriage, and death. These
                    rituals guide individuals in fulfilling their roles in society and in spiritual practice, often with
                    the aim of achieving spiritual growth and liberation.</p>

                    alt="Sannyasi" class="dharma-img">
                <p>Sannyasa, or renunciation, is a stage in the life of a person who chooses to give up worldly
                    attachments and live a life focused on spiritual pursuit. Dharma also encompasses the different
                    stages of life (known as Ashramas), including student, householder, hermit, and renunciant stages,
                    each with its own duties and responsibilities.</p>

                    alt="Teacher and Student" class="dharma-img">
                <p>Dharma includes the duty to learn from teachers (Guru), to respect and honor them, and to follow the
                    path of knowledge and self-realization. It emphasizes the transmission of wisdom and guidance from a
                    teacher to the student as an essential part of spiritual growth and duty in life.</p>
